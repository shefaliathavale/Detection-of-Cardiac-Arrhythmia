# Detection of Cardiac Arrhythmia

## What is the intent of this project?
Carrhythmia is a website which can help the doctors in determining whether the patient is suffering from Cardiac Arrhythmia or not. Detection of Cardiac Arrhythmia at an early stage can help avoid chronic heart diseases at a later stage. The system is developed using the Flask framework for deploying the ML model which, in this case, is the Xception model, a CNN architecture. Apart from detecting the disease, the system is also classifying it into the 14 classes of Arrhythmia with the help of Kernelized SVM. This system can prove to be super helpful to detect any cardiac irregularities at an early stage so as to avoid any major diseases or deaths in the future.
